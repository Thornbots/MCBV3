# MCBV3
Rose-Hulman Robomasters' (ThornBots) controls repository. Uses Taproot. Command-based and started from Teaching-Freshies

## Getting Started

First, **MAKE SURE TAPROOT IS PROPERLY INSTALLED**! If you haven't go ahead and check out our [software portal](https://thornbots-software.web.app) and 
check out our links page to get started with taproot.

Assuming you have taproot, run the following to clone this repository:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Thornbots/MCBV3.git
```

If you use the Docker container, or have already cloned the repository yourself, you should instead
run:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Finally, install `pipenv` and set up the build tools:

```
pip3 install pipenv
cd MCBV3/MCB-project/
pipenv install
```

Once finished, congratulations! You're ready to start coding!

## Writing and Flashing Code

All code is written in `MCB-Project/src/`. If you understand typical C++
and taproot, this should be relatively intuitive. 

To flash code, you'll need to be in the pipenv shell. If it's not running, use the following command to start it.

```
cd MCBV3/MCB-project/
pipenv shell
```

Note that this shell needs to be running to flash code, so every time you open a terminal you'll need to start it up again. Once it's running, you're ready to flash!
Don't forget, you should be in the `MCBV3/MCB-project` directory when running any of these commands! Once you're ready, run the following:

```
scons run
```

This command will build the robot code, prepping it to flash, then will proceed to flash it using `openocd`. Alternatively, you can run `scons build` to just build the code. You'll notice that this code will default to compiling the standard project. You can specify the robot type and the system identificaton enable using the command below:

```
scons run robot=<ROBOT_TYPE> sysid=<SYSID_TYPE>
```

These arguments will work for `scons build` too!

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions compiles ARM firmware for `infantry`, `hero`, and `sentry`
on main/nightly pushes and pull requests, including all four system identification modes. Each build uploads its ELF file for
inspection; CI never flashes a board. The hosted sentry job runs the package's
geometry and chassis GoogleTests, then builds real firmware and exercises its
UART parser, referee gates, aiming, firing, and driving through the pinned
current C++ `Thornbots/sim` fixture. A missing executable, empty test report,
or skipped UART test fails CI.

Run the C++ tests in a Linux terminal with GCC 14 and GoogleTest installed:

```bash
CXX=g++-14 tools/test_cpp.sh
(cd MCB-project && scons build-sim robot=sentry profile=release compiler-suffix=-14 -j4)
CXX=g++-14 tools/test_hosted_cpp.sh
```

This runner tests package-owned code directly. The historical `scons run-tests`
target also compiles vendored Taproot test suites and needs additional GoogleMock
dependencies. The UART fixture revision is pinned in
`.github/workflows/firmware.yml`; update it deliberately when the wire protocol
changes. ARM builds use Ubuntu 24.04's GCC 13 cross compiler; hosted builds use GCC 14.
All builds treat compiler warnings as errors. Hosted builds use the system GCC
by default; `compiler-suffix=-14` selects GCC 14 explicitly.

The `engineer` target (formerly `oldinfantry` / `oldstandard`) is excluded:
its indexer homing offset and power limiter torque scaling are missing. Restore measured calibration values before
enabling that target in CI. Build selection now uses `robot=engineer` (or
`ENGINEER`); the old target names are rejected. Its hardware lives in
`src/robots/engineer/EngineerHardware.hpp` and it retains the shared infantry
controls and legacy tuning pending calibration. An omitted `robot` still selects
this target, so specify `robot=sentry`, `robot=infantry`, or `robot=hero`
for a calibrated build.

`main` preserves its regenerated Taproot IMU API in radians and radians per
second. The hosted fixture uses the same units. Its referee schema uses the
2025 Taproot RFID fields: resupply outside/inside exchange at bits 19/20 and
central buff at bit 23. The C++ fixture encodes this current layout directly;
these checks do not measure robot calibration or field RFID placement.

## GCC compatibility

Motor feedback uses Taproot's encoder interface: positions and velocities are
in radians and radians per second. Flywheel and legacy indexer PID inputs are
explicitly converted to RPM. UART timeouts use the boot millisecond clock and
unsigned subtraction so they survive its 32-bit rollover.

The bare board has no POSIX files, process control, or entropy source.
Package-owned newlib hooks return failure with `ENOSYS`; `_getpid` identifies
the single firmware process. Hardware I/O still goes through Taproot.
These hooks let modern newlib link without its warning-bearing nosys fallbacks.

The generated Taproot/modm copies checked into this repository contain local
compatibility fixes: explicit iterator traits instead of `std::iterator`,
`delay_us`, guarded peripheral clock writes, and erase/remove for null command
mappings. Preserve these fixes when regenerating from the pinned upstream
submodules. The hosted C++ regression tests check iterator traits, null command
filtering, UART payload bounds, and clock rollover.
